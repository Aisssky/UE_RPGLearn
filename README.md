# UE5 Assassin's Creed Style Demo

## Project Overview
This is a third-person action-adventure game demo developed based on Unreal Engine 5. Its core gameplay and artistic style are inspired by the classic Assassin's Creed series.

> Important Notice: This is a Personal Learning Project
The development of this project strictly followed the tutorial series by the YouTube channel Gorka Games.
All core code logic and implementation ideas originate from said tutorials, with the aim of learning the UE5 game development workflow.
This project is for non-commercial use only, intended solely for learning and exchange purposes.

Acknowledgement: Sincere thanks to Gorka Games for producing and sharing such high-quality, detailed free tutorials.I will be thankful for a lifetime for this series

## Features & Implementation
By completing this demo, I learned and implemented the following features:

- Third-person Character Controls: Fluid character movement, sprinting, and jumping.

- Combat System: Basic light attack, heavy attack combos, and an enemy lock-on mechanism.

- Climbing & Parkour System (MVP): Initial implementation of climbing and movement on specific environmental objects.

- Animation Blueprints: Utilizing state machines to blend complex animations for character movement and combat.

- UI & HUD: Simple health and stamina UI display.

## Key Learnings
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:

- The fundamental collaboration between UE5 Blueprints and C++.

- The core logic behind game character control and camera management.

- The powerful functionalities of Animation Blueprints and State Machines.

- Basic game architecture thinking and modular design concepts.

## Future Learning & Improvement Directions

Based on mastering the tutorial content, I plan to explore the following enhancements in the future:

- Transition Blueprint logic to C++: Gradually convert core gameplay systems from Blueprints to C++ to deepen my understanding of Unreal Engine's C++ API and enhance performance.
